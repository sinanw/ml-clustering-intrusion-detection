# ml-clustering-intrusion-detection
The aim of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning to perform intrusion analysis and detection on a network traffic dataset. Although the task performed is clustering analysis, the dataset used has its samples labeled into groups, the original labels will be used as ground truth to evaluate the clustering results.

Note: this project is under development and new updates will be committed regularly. The readme file will be updated when the project is finalized.
